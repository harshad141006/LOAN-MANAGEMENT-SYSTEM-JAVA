 Objective:

To manage loan records of customers, including loan details, payments, and balances.

** Features (basic level):

1. Add Customer Loan → Enter details (Loan ID, Customer Name, Loan Amount, Interest Rate, Duration).


2. Search Loan Record → Find by Loan ID or Customer Name.


3. Calculate EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) using formula:



EMI = \frac{P \times R \times (1+R)^N}{(1+R)^N - 1}

R = Monthly Interest Rate

N = Number of Months


4. Update Loan → Change amount, duration, or status.


5. Delete Loan Record.


6. Display All Loans → Show all customer loans with EMI & status.
